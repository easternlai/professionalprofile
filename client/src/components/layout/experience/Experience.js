          <p><b>About iRhythm: </b>I've held three different positions in this company. From part-time employee to full time intern and now finally as a full time employee in the data division. I am responsible for the extraction of high quality data from the web. I develop software that extracts information from the unstructured deep web and that converts it into a structured format for further data analysis.</p>
          <p><b>Position Description: </b> I completed two courses at ROC Twente. The first course was a computer science course after which I did an additional year in application development. This combination gave me a good understanding of both hardware and software. The application development course was originally a two year track but I graduated a year early.
